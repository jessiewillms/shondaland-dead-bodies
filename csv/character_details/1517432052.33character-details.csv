He immediately leaped into action, saving four people from the wreckage before the emergency officials arrived to take the patients to Dillard Medical Center. Derek returned to his car and began to pull out to turn around when his phone suddenly rang. Leaving the car sideways in the middle of the road, he began reaching for the phone, not noticing an approaching semi, which crashed into the side of his car. Derek was then taken to Dillard where the doctors began examining him. Conscious but unable to speak, he knew that he needed a head CT, and begged in his mind for the doctors to also realize this, but to no avail. Derek was rushed to the OR , but by the time the doctors figured out what was going on and managed to bring in a neurosurgeon (whom they had to wait for over an hour after paging him), it was already too late and Derek was pronounced brain dead. Not long after, Meredith, whom the police have brought to the hospital, signed the papers to take him off life-support. She then sat with him as he died, holding his chest and telling him ""You can go"" as he let out his last breath. Interestingly, he continued to narrate in his mind up to almost the very end, even after losing consciousness (and possibly all brain function) -- at one point saying to the attending physicians ""It\'s too late."" ""You\'re too late."" We are left with the feeling that at some point an ethereal consciousness had taken over where his physical brain was no longer capable.\n</p>']",['No treatment available'],Patrick Dempsey,multiple,"['S-1-EP-1', 'S-1-EP-4', 'S-1-EP-7', 'S-1-EP-2', 'S-1-EP-5', 'S-1-EP-8', 'S-1-EP-3', 'S-1-EP-6', 'S-1-EP-9', 'S-2-EP-1', 'S-2-EP-10', 'S-2-EP-19', 'S-2-EP-2', 'S-2-EP-11', 'S-2-EP-20', 'S-2-EP-3', 'S-2-EP-12', 'S-2-EP-21', 'S-2-EP-4', 'S-2-EP-13', 'S-2-EP-22', 'S-2-EP-5', 'S-2-EP-14', 'S-2-EP-23', 'S-2-EP-6', 'S-2-EP-15', 'S-2-EP-24', 'S-2-EP-7', 'S-2-EP-16', 'S-2-EP-25', 'S-2-EP-8', 'S-2-EP-17', 'S-2-EP-26', 'S-2-EP-9', 'S-2-EP-18', 'S-2-EP-27', 'S-3-EP-1', 'S-3-EP-10', 'S-3-EP-19', 'S-3-EP-2', 'S-3-EP-11', 'S-3-EP-20', 'S-3-EP-3', 'S-3-EP-12', 'S-3-EP-21', 'S-3-EP-4', 'S-3-EP-13', 'S-3-EP-22', 'S-3-EP-5', 'S-3-EP-14', 'S-3-EP-23', 'S-3-EP-6', 'S-3-EP-15', 'S-3-EP-24', 'S-3-EP-7', 'S-3-EP-16', 'S-3-EP-25', 'S-3-EP-8', 'S-3-EP-17', 'S-3-EP-9', 'S-3-EP-18', 'S-4-EP-1', 'S-4-EP-7', 'S-4-EP-13', 'S-4-EP-2', 'S-4-EP-8', 'S-4-EP-14', 'S-4-EP-3', 'S-4-EP-9', 'S-4-EP-15', 'S-4-EP-4', 'S-4-EP-10', 'S-4-EP-16', 'S-4-EP-5', 'S-4-EP-11', 'S-4-EP-17', 'S-4-EP-6', 'S-4-EP-12', 'S-5-EP-1', 'S-5-EP-9', 'S-5-EP-17', 'S-5-EP-2', 'S-5-EP-10', 'S-5-EP-18', 'S-5-EP-3', 'S-5-EP-11', 'S-5-EP-19', 'S-5-EP-4', 'S-5-EP-12', 'S-5-EP-20', 'S-5-EP-5', 'S-5-EP-13', 'S-5-EP-21', 'S-5-EP-6', 'S-5-EP-14', 'S-5-EP-22', 'S-5-EP-7', 'S-5-EP-15', 'S-5-EP-23', 'S-5-EP-8', 'S-5-EP-16', 'S-5-EP-24', 'S-6-EP-1', 'S-6-EP-9', 'S-6-EP-17', 'S-6-EP-2', 'S-6-EP-10', 'S-6-EP-18', 'S-6-EP-3', 'S-6-EP-11', 'S-6-EP-19', 'S-6-EP-4', 'S-6-EP-12', 'S-6-EP-20', 'S-6-EP-5', 'S-6-EP-13', 'S-6-EP-21', 'S-6-EP-6', 'S-6-EP-14', 'S-6-EP-22', 'S-6-EP-7', 'S-6-EP-15', 'S-6-EP-23', 'S-6-EP-8', 'S-6-EP-16', 'S-6-EP-24', 'S-7-EP-1', 'S-7-EP-9', 'S-7-EP-17', 'S-7-EP-2', 'S-7-EP-10', 'S-7-EP-18', 'S-7-EP-3', 'S-7-EP-11', 'S-7-EP-19', 'S-7-EP-4', 'S-7-EP-12', 'S-7-EP-20', 'S-7-EP-5', 'S-7-EP-13', 'S-7-EP-21', 'S-7-EP-6', 'S-7-EP-14', 'S-7-EP-22', 'S-7-EP-7', 'S-7-EP-15', 'S-7-EP-8', 'S-7-EP-16', 'S-8-EP-1', 'S-8-EP-9', 'S-8-EP-17', 'S-8-EP-2', 'S-8-EP-10', 'S-8-EP-18', 'S-8-EP-3', 'S-8-EP-11', 'S-8-EP-19', 'S-8-EP-4', 'S-8-EP-12', 'S-8-EP-20', 'S-8-EP-5', 'S-8-EP-13', 'S-8-EP-21', 'S-8-EP-6', 'S-8-EP-14', 'S-8-EP-22', 'S-8-EP-7', 'S-8-EP-15', 'S-8-EP-23', 'S-8-EP-8', 'S-8-EP-16', 'S-8-EP-24', 'S-9-EP-1', 'S-9-EP-9', 'S-9-EP-17', 'S-9-EP-2', 'S-9-EP-10', 'S-9-EP-18', 'S-9-EP-3', 'S-9-EP-11', 'S-9-EP-19', 'S-9-EP-4', 'S-9-EP-12', 'S-9-EP-20', 'S-9-EP-5', 'S-9-EP-13', 'S-9-EP-21', 'S-9-EP-6', 'S-9-EP-14', 'S-9-EP-22', 'S-9-EP-7', 'S-9-EP-15', 'S-9-EP-23', 'S-9-EP-8', 'S-9-EP-16', 'S-9-EP-24', 'S-10-EP-1', 'S-10-EP-9', 'S-10-EP-17', 'S-10-EP-2', 'S-10-EP-10', 'S-10-EP-18', 'S-10-EP-3', 'S-10-EP-11', 'S-10-EP-19', 'S-10-EP-4', 'S-10-EP-12', 'S-10-EP-20', 'S-10-EP-5', 'S-10-EP-13', 'S-10-EP-21', 'S-10-EP-6', 'S-10-EP-14', 'S-10-EP-22', 'S-10-EP-7', 'S-10-EP-15', 'S-10-EP-23', 'S-10-EP-8', 'S-10-EP-16', 'S-10-EP-24', 'S-11-EP-1', 'S-11-EP-9', 'S-11-EP-17', 'S-11-EP-2', 'S-11-EP-18', 'S-11-EP-3', 'S-11-EP-19', 'S-11-EP-4', 'S-11-EP-20', 'S-11-EP-5', 'S-11-EP-21', 'S-11-EP-6', 'S-11-EP-22', 'S-11-EP-7', 'S-11-EP-8', 'S-11-EP-16', 'S-11-EP-24', 'S-2-EP-16', 'S-5-EP-15', 'S-5-EP-8', 'S-1-EP-1', 'S-11-EP-24']",A_Hard_Day%27s_Night,A Hard Day's Night,You%27re_My_Home,You're My Home,"['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11']"
