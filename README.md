# shondaland-dead-bodies

This is an attempt to learn Python by scraping the wiki for Grey's Anatomy. 

This page to get every character that has died on Grey's: http://greysanatomy.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Deceased_Characters

* Note: Not every character that has died in the Grey's universe â€” ie., if a character was on Grey's but *died* in an episode of Private Practice, it does not count here. 

** Note: Some of the filtering out of Private Practice characters (ie., main cast on PP, but appears on the list of deceased characters page) was done by hand (because have yet to find a way to do this with Python?). See remove_these_pp_characters
