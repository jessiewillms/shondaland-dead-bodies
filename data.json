She had surgery to remove more cancer from her body and continued to have radiation and chemotherapy. When she complained of stomach pain, Meredith ordered a new CT, which showed a met near her liver, which was causing the pain. When Meredith advised against removing it, Maggie pressured Diane to fire her. Maggie then found a clinical trial with promising early results that she could get into if they could lower her LFTs. Bailey figured out a way to place a stent to lower Diane's LFTs and get her into the trial. The procedure worked, but Bailey, Richard, and Jackson didn't think the trial was a good idea. Despite this and Richard advising Diane that it wasn't a good idea, Maggie pushed forward and Diane supported her, believing Maggie wouldn't do anything to hurt her.\n</p><p>Once on the treatment, Diane had multiple side effects. She got an infection in her arm and blood built up. She had to have fluid aspirated from her back, but she eventually started to feel a little better. She taught Maggie to make her lasagna and told Maggie to invite all her friends over to have dinner together. At the dinner, Diane started coughing heavily. She soon coughed up some blood and they rushed her to the hospital. She had a tear in her esophagus, which Richard repaired with difficulty. Maggie wanted to get her up and moving again after the surgery as soon as possible, because she'd lose her spot in the trial if she missed a treatment. Richard went and talked to Diane privately, to tell her she didn't have to keep going with the treatment if she didn't want to. She told him Maggie was a gift to her and if she died, it would give Maggie darkness not to know she did everything she could and she didn't want to do that. Richard told her Maggie was strong and she could handle it. Maggie tried to call around to find newer treatment possibilities for her mother, but Diane told her it was time to stop fighting.\n</p>"], "character_type": "family", "image":

goodbye to Derek.</p> \t\t \t</figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Not long after his return home, Derek was on his way to the airport for one last trip to D.C. when he witnessed a car crash on a remote road. He immediately leaped into action, saving four people from the wreckage before the emergency officials arrived to take the patients to Dillard Medical Center. Derek returned to his car and began to pull out to turn around when his phone suddenly rang. Leaving the car sideways in the middle of the road, he began reaching for the phone, not noticing an approaching semi, which crashed into the side of his car. Derek was then taken to Dillard where the doctors began examining him. Conscious but unable to speak, he knew that he needed a head CT, and begged in his mind for the doctors to also realize this, but to no avail. Derek was rushed to the OR , but by the time the doctors figured out what was going on and managed to bring in a neurosurgeon (whom they had to wait for over an hour after paging him), it was already too late and Derek was pronounced brain dead. Not long after, Meredith, whom the police have brought to the hospital, signed the papers to take him off life-support. She then sat with him as he died, holding his chest and telling him \"You can go\" as he let out his last breath. Interestingly, he continued to narrate in his mind up to almost the very end, even after losing consciousness (and possibly all brain function) -- at one point saying to the attending physicians \"It's too late.\" \"You're too late.\" We are left with the feeling that at some point an ethereal consciousness had taken over where his physical brain was no longer capable.\n</p>"], "character_type": "attending", "image": "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/greysanatomy/images/f/fb/11x21-4.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/335?cb=20150423224437", "first_episode_title_text": "A Hard Day's Night", "actor": "Patrick Dempsey", "character_gender": "male", "season_episode_code": ["S-1-EP-1", "S-1-EP-4", "S-1-EP-7", "S-1-EP-2", "S-1-EP-5", "S-1-EP-8", "S-1-EP-3", "S-1-EP-6", "S-1-EP-9", "S-2-EP-1", "S-2-EP-10", "S-2-EP-19", "S-2-EP-2", "S-2-EP-11", "S-2-EP-20", "S-2-EP-3", "S-2-EP-12", "S-2-EP-21", "S-2-EP-4", "S-2-EP-13", "S-2-EP-22", "S-2-EP-5", "S-2-EP-14", "S-2-EP-23", "S-2-EP-6", "S-2-EP-15", "S-2-EP-24", "S-2-EP-7", "S-2-EP-16", "S-2-EP-25", "S-2-EP-8", "S-2-EP-17", "S-2-EP-26", "S-2-EP-9", "S-2-EP-18", "S-2-EP-27", "S-3-EP-1", "S-3-EP-10", "S-3-EP-19", "S-3-EP-2", "S-3-EP-11", "S-3-EP-20", "S-3-EP-3", "S-3-EP-12", "S-3-EP-21", "S-3-EP-4", "S-3-EP-13", "S-3-EP-22", "S-3-EP-5", "S-3-EP-14", "S-3-EP-23", "S-3-EP-6", "S-3-EP-15", "S-3-EP-24", "S-3-EP-7", "S-3-EP-16", "S-3-EP-25", "S-3-EP-8", "S-3-EP-17", "S-3-EP-9", "S-3-EP-18", "S-4-EP-1", "S-4-EP-7", "S-4-EP-13", "S-4-EP-2", "S-4-EP-8", "S-4-EP-14", "S-4-EP-3", "S-4-EP-9", "S-4-EP-15", "S-4-EP-4", "S-4-EP-10", "S-4-EP-16", "S-4-EP-5", "S-4-EP-11", "S-4-EP-17", "S-4-EP-6", "S-4-EP-12", "S-5-EP-1", "S-5-EP-9", "S-5-EP-17", "S-5-EP-2", "S-5-EP-10", "S-5-EP-18", "S-5-EP-3", "S-5-EP-11", "S-5-EP-19", "S-5-EP-4", "S-5-EP-12", "S-5-EP-20", "S-5-EP-5", "S-5-EP-13", "S-5-EP-21", "S-5-EP-6", "S-5-EP-14", "S-5-EP-22", "S-5-EP-7", "S-5-EP-15", "S-5-EP-23", "S-5-EP-8", "S-5-EP-16", "S-5-EP-24", "S-6-EP-1", "S-6-EP-9", "S-6-EP-17", "S-6-EP-2", "S-6-EP-10", "S-6-EP-18", "S-6-EP-3", "S-6-EP-11", "S-6-EP-19", "S-6-EP-4", "S-6-EP-12", "S-6-EP-20", "S-6-EP-5", "S-6-EP-13", "S-6-EP-21", "S-6-EP-6", "S-6-EP-14", "S-6-EP-22", "S-6-EP-7", "S-6-EP-15", "S-6-EP-23", "S-6-EP-8", "S-6-EP-16", "S-6-EP-24", "S-7-EP-1", "S-7-EP-9", "S-7-EP-17", "S-7-EP-2", "S-7-EP-10", "S-7-EP-18", "S-7-EP-3", "S-7-EP-11", "S-7-EP-19", "S-7-EP-4", "S-7-EP-12", "S-7-EP-20", "S-7-EP-5", "S-7-EP-13", "S-7-EP-21", "S-7-EP-6", "S-7-EP-14", "S-7-EP-22", "S-7-EP-7", "S-7-EP-15", "S-7-EP-8", "S-7-EP-16", "S-8-EP-1", "S-8-EP-9", "S-8-EP-17", "S-8-EP-2", "S-8-EP-10", "S-8-EP-18", "S-8-EP-3", "S-8-EP-11", "S-8-EP-19", "S-8-EP-4", "S-8-EP-12", "S-8-EP-20", "S-8-EP-5", "S-8-EP-13", "S-8-EP-21", "S-8-EP-6", "S-8-EP-14", "S-8-EP-22", "S-8-EP-7", "S-8-EP-15", "S-8-EP-23", "S-8-EP-8", "S-8-EP-16", "S-8-EP-24", "S-9-EP-1", "S-9-EP-9", "S-9-EP-17", "S-9-EP-2", "S-9-EP-10", "S-9-EP-18", "S-9-EP-3", "S-9-EP-11", "S-9-EP-19", "S-9-EP-4", "S-9-EP-12", "S-9-EP-20", "S-9-EP-5", "S-9-EP-13", "S-9-EP-21", "S-9-EP-6", "S-9-EP-14", "S-9-EP-22", "S-9-EP-7", "S-9-EP-15", "S-9-EP-23", "S-9-EP-8", "S-9-EP-16", "S-9-EP-24", "S-10-EP-1", "S-10-EP-9", "S-10-EP-17", "S-10-EP-2", "S-10-EP-10", "S-10-EP-18", "S-10-EP-3", "S-10-EP-11", "S-10-EP-19", "S-10-EP-4", "S-10-EP-12", "S-10-EP-20", "S-10-EP-5", "S-10-EP-13", "S-10-EP-21", "S-10-EP-6", "S-10-EP-14", "S-10-EP-22", "S-10-EP-7", "S-10-EP-15", "S-10-EP-23", "S-10-EP-8", "S-10-EP-16", "S-10-EP-24", "S-11-EP-1", "S-11-EP-9", "S-11-EP-17", "S-11-EP-2", "S-11-EP-18", "S-11-EP-3", "S-11-EP-19", "S-11-EP-4", "S-11-EP-20", "S-11-EP-5", "S-11-EP-21", "S-11-EP-6", "S-11-EP-22", "S-11-EP-7", "S-11-EP-8", "S-11-EP-16", "S-11-EP-24", "S-2-EP-16", "S-5-EP-15", "S-5-EP-8", "S-1-EP-1", "S-11-EP-24"], "last_episode_title_text": "You're My Home", "treatment": ["Surgery"], "diagnosis": ["Car accident injuries", "Brain death"], "single_or_multiple_episodes": "multiple", "last_episode_title_underscore": "You%27re_My_Home", "seasons_array": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11"], "character_major_or_minor": "major", "character_name": "Derek Shepherd"}, {"count": 129, "first_episode_title_underscore": "Who_We_Are", "cause_of_death": ["<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"After_His_Death\">After His Death</span><span class=\"editsection\"><a href=\"/wiki/Mr._Shepherd?action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit After His Death section\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D\" class=\"sprite edit-pencil\" />Edit</a></span></h3>\n<p>Years later, his death is still difficult for his family.
